                                Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. 
                                Their classic line-up was 
                                Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass).
                                Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. 
                                Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques.
                                He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". 
                                Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973.
                                Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. 
                                In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. 
                                In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia – a complication of AIDS – and Deacon retired in 1997. 
                                Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the "Queen +" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.

                                Freddie Mercury (born 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer, songwriter, record producer, and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen.
                                Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, 
                                he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. 
                                Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.
                                As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, 
                                the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. 
                                In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music</span>

                                Brian Harold May CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and astrophysicist. 
                                He is the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen.
                                May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, 
                                having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, 
                                which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of 
                                their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, 
                                Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with 
                                the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian Rhapsody".
